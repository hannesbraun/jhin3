\section{Introduction}

Jhin3 is a console soundboard with some additional timer and stopwatch functionality.

The main features are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Soundboard with 3 different sound types (normal, loop and one shot)
\item Configurable through a json file
\item Timer
\item 4 stopwatches
\item Different themes to choose from
\end{itemize}

This manual is still not complete yet. I will extend it together with further releases in the future. However, it should contain the necessary information to run Jhin3.
